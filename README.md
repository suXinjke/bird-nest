# Bird Nest

There are numerous moments when I really need a local sandbox or very specific example, but I don't have one, or it's already somewhere on my disk, outdated and messed up. I just want to put organize all of this in one dedicated place.

I can also benefit from easily discarding the test changes with git, or branching off.
